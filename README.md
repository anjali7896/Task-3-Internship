# Task-3-Internship
This Java program demonstrates how to create and manage a list of employees using object-oriented programming and Java Collections. It shows how to:

- Create an `Employee` class with name, age, and salary.
- Use a constructor and override `toString()` for easy display.
- Store multiple `Employee` objects in an `ArrayList`.
- Sort employees by:
  - **Salary (Descending)**
  - **Name (Ascending)** using different `Comparator` implementations.
